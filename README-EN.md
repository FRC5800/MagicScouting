# About the Project

This is a scouting application developed by FRC Team 5800, with the goal of helping other teams with this crucial part of the competition. The project consists of two main tools: a mobile and web application used for data collection, and another section of the app dedicated to data analysis.

# Support Guides

All usage guides are available in our repository [Wiki](https://github.com/FRC5800/MagicScouting/wiki). Before downloading the project, make sure to read the documentation.
